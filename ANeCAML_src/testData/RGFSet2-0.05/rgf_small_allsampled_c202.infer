Clade 1-1
Chain of Inference : 1-2-3-4 NO
Restricted gene flow with isolation by distance (restricted dispersal by distance in non-sexual species).

Clade 1-4
Chain of Inference : 1-2-3-5-6*-7-8 YES
Restricted gene flow/dispersal but with some long-distance dispersal over intermediate areas not occupied by the species; or past gene flow followed by extinction of intermediate populations.
Too few Clades: Insufficient genetic resolution to discriminate between range expansion/colonization and restricted dispersal/gene flow.
Question 7 and 8 try to distinguish between long vs. short distance movement
