Clade 1-1
Chain of Inference : 1-2-3-4 NO
Restricted gene flow with isolation by distance (restricted dispersal by distance in non-sexual species).

Clade 1-2
Chain of Inference : Null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
Moving on to next clade

Clade 1-3
Chain of Inference : 1-2-3-5-15 NO
Long-distance colonisation and/or past fragmenation (not necessarily mutually exclusive).

Clade 1-4
Chain of Inference : Null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
Moving on to next clade

Clade 1-5
Chain of Inference : Null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
Moving on to next clade

Clade 1-7
Chain of Inference : 1-19-20-2 IO
I-T Status Undetermined: Inconclusive outcome.

Clade 2-1
Chain of Inference : 1-2-3-4 NO
Restricted gene flow with isolation by distance (restricted dispersal by distance in non-sexual species).

Clade 2-2
Chain of Inference : 1-2-11-12 NO
Contiguous range expansion.

Clade 2-3
Chain of Inference : 1-2-11-12 NO
Contiguous range expansion.

Clade 3-2
Chain of Inference : 1-2-3-5-6*-7-8 YES
Restricted gene flow/dispersal but with some long-distance dispersal over intermediate areas not occupied by the species; or past gene flow followed by extinction of intermediate populations.
Too few Clades: Insufficient genetic resolution to discriminate between range expansion/colonization and restricted dispersal/gene flow.
Question 7 and 8 try to distinguish between long vs. short distance movement
