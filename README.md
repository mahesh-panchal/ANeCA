ANeCA: Automated Nested Clade Analysis

ANeCA is an implementation of a method of analysis called Nested Clade Phylogeographic Analysis (NCPA). At the time, the method was a point of contention within the phylogeographic community. A PhD project was born to automate the method from start to finish, so that it could be evaluated. Evaluations of ANeCA on previously published analyses resulted in a strong correlation of results, indicating that the tool correctly implements the analysis in a way other researchers used NCPA. Evaluations on simple phylogeographic models however indicated that the method will provide many false positive inferences, in particular when there is no underlying phyloegeogeographic structure. Please see the relevant articles (in the folder `docs`) for more details on the automation and evaluation of this method.
